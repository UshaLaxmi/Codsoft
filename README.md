Over the course of my development journey, I had worked intership with basic Web Development in the CodSoft Company from November1 to November29 2024 completed. The Intenship projects include three different tasks that are listed in below with its desciption as follows:

Task 1: Landing Page using HTML and CSS:
Landing Page: The Landing Page project focused on creating a visually appealing and informative introductory page for a brand, product, or service. The page was designed to capture users' attention and guide them toward a specific call to action (CTA), such as signing up, learning more, or making a purchase. I used HTML for the structure and CSS for styling, including responsive design techniques with media queries to ensure the page functions smoothly across all devices. This project reinforced my skills in designing web pages with a focus on user engagement, clear messaging, and a responsive layout.

Task 2: Portfolio website usign HTML and CSS:
Personal Portfolio: The Personal Portfolio website serves as a digital resume and showcase of my web development skills, projects, and experience. It features a clean, modern design with sections such as "About Me," "Projects," "Skills," and "Contact." The portfolio is fully responsive, ensuring optimal viewing and navigation across devices, and is designed to reflect my personal branding. Through this project, I honed my ability to create professional, user-friendly websites that not only showcase technical skills but also tell a story about who I am as a developer. The portfolio includes interactive elements, such as a smooth navigation system and well-organized project displays, allowing users to easily explore my work.

Task 3: Calculator Application using HTML and CSS:
Calculator Application: The Calculator Application project involved building a simple, interactive web-based calculator using HTML and CSS. The primary objective was to create a clean, intuitive interface where users could perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The design was responsive, ensuring that the layout adapts well across different screen sizes, making the app accessible and functional on both desktop and mobile devices. This project helped me sharpen my skills in layout design and user interface (UI) creation, along with understanding the importance of simplicity and usability.
